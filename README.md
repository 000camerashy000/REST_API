### <u>What does an API do </u>? 
API is a communication medium between two programs or systems. The client is the user/customer (who sends the request), the medium is the API, and the server is the backend (where the request is accepted and a response is provided).

* The client initiates the requests via the APIs URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) â€”> A URI is used to distinguish one resource from another. The strings of characters incorporated in a URI serve as identifiers, such as a scheme name and a file path. Every **URL** is an **URI** but every **URI** is not an **URL**
* The API makes a call to the server after receiving the request
* Then the server sends the response back to the API with the information
* Finally, the API transfers the data to the client

## <u>How is an API Different From a Web Application?</u>
A web application is a network-based resource responsible for completing a single task, v/s APIs as a tool is used to allow one system to leverage the functionalities of another without needing to understand the internal workings of that system.
